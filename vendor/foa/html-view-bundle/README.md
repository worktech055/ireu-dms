# FOA.Html_View_Bundle

Only useful when integrating 
[aura/html](https://packagist.org/packages/aura/html) and 
[aura/view](https://packagist.org/packages/aura/view) with
[aura/di](https://packagist.org/packages/aura/di).

This package has only one class `FOA\Html_View_Bundle\_Config\Common`.

Please see the integration test for how it works.
The order is **really important**, else the objects will be different.
